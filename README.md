##_ultimate nfm2 java guide_
*"Hello there mate. So you want to hack, and have found my files. Well, there's no place to start but at the beginning."*

**NFM2 is programmed with JAVA!** If you have no idea what that is, or are scratching your head at what programming is, you definitely need to look over
these pages linked below. Even if you have basic knowledge from some project or class you took once, 
reading through these will help you avoid ERRORS!!!

- [Java - Basic Datatypes](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_basic_datatypes.htm)
- [Java - Variable Types](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_variable_types.htm)
- [Java - Basic Operators](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_basic_operators.htm)
- [Java - Methods](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_methods.htm)

That is the BARE MINIMUM. Feel free to browse around that site a bit more. You wont encounter much more than the above in NFMs files, but it doesn't hurt
to know.

Now that you got that, it's time to get into what makes my files special!!! ♥♥♥

These files are FIXED and READY TO HACK!!! They already contain a project file for BlueJ, double-click and you can begin hacking immediately!

The following is what has been done:

 - Most NFMM graphics (except for sparks and new dust)
 - NFMM Car Maker codes work correctly
 - Floating ```set()``` and ```chk()``` hack
 - Helpful methods: e.g. ```colorinvert()```, ```paintcs()```, ```imagefilter()``` 
 - Bug fixing! (e.g. DragShot's fixed ```sortcars()```, Readded ```savecookie()``` and ```readcookie()```, improved ```drag[]``` alternative)

This is what will come:

- 100% NFMM graphics
- More bug fixes
- Add in as many enhancements as I can to make hacking easier and fun!
