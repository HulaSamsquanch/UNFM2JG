What you need:
- [BlueJ 3.*](https://bluej.org/versions.html)
- [JRE 7u21](http://mediafire.com/download/wku5c1z9vsciv6n/jre-7u21-windows-i586.exe)
- [JDK 7u21](http://mediafire.com/download/miy7j6meg9mi721/jdk-7u21-windows-i586.exe)

I use BlueJ 3.1.7 currently.

Blue 4.* needs Java 8 to work.

To test the game:
- Open the BlueJ project file
- Right click GameSparker
- Compile
- Right click GameSparker again
- Run Applet
- A Dialog comes up
- Click ok

Create a jar file (run without BlueJ):
- Open the BlueJ project file
- At the toolbar click Project
- Click "Create jar File..."
- At the Main class dropdown pick "RunApp"
- Click Continue
- Go to the folder where your project is
- Give it a file name
- Click Create
- (It takes some time to compile the file)
- Once compiling is done open the jar file

Now you can run the game without BlueJ
